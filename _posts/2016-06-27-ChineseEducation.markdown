Having been in China for a couple years, I've come to observe the local school system a bit with my little sister in the school system and many of my friends having matriculated from the schools as well. It's an interesting dilemma because many of these students that come out of these schools are frankly at the very least hardworking, and most of them quite smart. However, there seems to be a universal consensus that this system fails on a larger scale. 


Stemming from its over-working of young kids, the Chinese school system from a very young age instills a learning philosophy of hard work and sacrifice of other activities for your education. My little sister mentioned to me (her experience ends at primary school), she was up till 12 AM many nights working on her school homework. For me, who grew up in California, this idea was unfathomable. In the US, primary school consisted of a healthy blend of schoolwork and extracurriculars, allowing for a childhood where school had yet to define our lives. 


Yet, I have to question the motivations between each systems. It's not necessarily a bad thing to have school systems that place a heavier emphasis on education, after all, most of our population finds their purpose in society through their education. However, we'd also be foolish to completely neglect the importance of finding passions beyond the classroom and recognizing applications of their knowledge in the outside world. 


It's very interesting to me because many of my classmates that have graduated from local schools have much stronger fundamentals than me, but they also have less ideas for what they want to do with what they've learned. They see the path through college, but they don't really see the path afterwards. A perfect harmony of the two, where people's passions are explored while also having iron-clad fundamentals to allow them to pursue these passions without fear or gaps in knowledge would produce many great students. 

I currently think about these things because I have spent some time just considering the differences between myself and my friends which leads to a lot of interesting discussions between us.
