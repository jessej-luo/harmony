This is my first post just to introduce some of the interesting things I've been exploring or working on this summer and will keep it updated.

This summer I'll mostly be working on a web development team for a small biotech company called Adagene, where I'll post some new ideas and techniques I've been learning. I'm starting some education research with the BJC team on the autograder, and finally doing some more work with an education startup called Paradigm Shift. I'll also be exploring the OpenIOT framework to learn more about the integration of various sensors and using this to learn about data.

I'll mostly be posting about my explorations in web development but also in machine learning. Furthermore, I hope to learn about becoming a better teacher and understanding the challenges specifically in computer science education.

See you next time!
